**DAY 3**

audio is important. the sound is overlooked. whats the problem we want to solve? how to make it more personalised? how to add more personal interactions in the digital communication? the theme that no one put a hard focus on. how to bring liveliness into the communication between the call participants #team #collaboration #sound
