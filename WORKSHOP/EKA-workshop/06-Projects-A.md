## Social behaviour online, politics

**27-10-2021** 

*"Why are we here ?"* - All of us

The goal of the day was to define better our subject. We started with the "what if" exercice, which took us to the subject of the methodology applied during this workshop. One issue that we faced is a transparency issue, which we were able to solve by questionning our motivations. Through theses questions, we were able to identify the common issue.
The issue was our misunderstanding on the reason we are here, together in this workshop.
After this long discussion, and sharing the insights we gained from the interview realised that day with Annie Abrahams and Ãœlo Vihma, we voted on our ideas with a method called *dotmocracy*. We settled on the following theme :
*Create a platform that adapts to different situation*
Tomorrow we will have to define more precisely the theme we choose, before sketching new ideas.
