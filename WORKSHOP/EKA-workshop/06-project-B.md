**DAY 3**

struggling in the beginning how to approach the topic

how to start ideating. made sure that they agree on the topic. emotional bond - creativity. developed those concepts. afterwards they have started sketching out the what if, visualising it. building it on the way. trying to put all elements of what we want to include. came up with different ideas. creating a social link about the rituals (individual, or social) #emotionalbond #privatespace #personalexperience 

grocery list - we cook at this day at this hour - it is about talking and discussing how to cook things.  what is a ritual? why is it important to share?
