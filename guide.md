## Create a new page

You can create a new page anytime and afterwards, you can modify and move it.
Be careful to choose a correct path (no illegal caracters), if your path indicate that your new page is in a new folder, it will be create automatically;
Please, make sure to use the markdown editor and not the WYSIWIG and HTML ones, we need the same type of documents.

## Insert link and image, put together the navigation

To insert image, you need to upload, and after that, you can insert link to the media.
To write a hyperlink, you will use the same syntaxe without the exclamation symbole.
For the navigation, you will use internal links and write path to the page that you need. 

## Markdown

You can find a *markdown formatting help* at the left bottom of the navbar in the markdown editor (the question mark icon)
Here a small reminder :
-	title and subtitle is the # symbol
