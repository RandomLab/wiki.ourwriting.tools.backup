## Create a new page

You can create a new page anytime and afterwards, you can modify and move it.
Be careful to choose a correct path (no illegal caracters), if your path indicate that your new page is in a new folder, it will be create automatically;
Please, make sure to use the markdown editor and not the WYSIWIG and HTML ones, we need the same type of documents.

## Insert link and image, put together the navigation

To insert image, you need to upload, and after that, you can insert link to the media.
To write a hyperlink, you will use the same syntaxe without the exclamation symbole.
For the navigation, you will use internal links and write path to the page that you need. 

## Markdown

You can find a *markdown formatting help* at the left bottom of the navbar in the markdown editor (the question mark icon)
Here a small reminder :
-	title and subtitle is the # symbol
- italic is *
- bold is **

## How to name files

For now, we will use the Kebab case to name the files. Files and folders names must be written all in lowercase, with dashes separating words such as following :

`example-name-of-file`
