## Introduction
This is the first workshop for the project digital tools.

We started the day 1 by [sharing our experiences online](/en/tallinn-workshop/sharing-experiences)

After the lunch in the cafeteria, students gathered in groups of two, to share the results of their second homework. They had to describe their [from-daily-routine-to-theme](/en/tallinn-workshop/from-daily-routine-to-theme)daily routine as a designer.
